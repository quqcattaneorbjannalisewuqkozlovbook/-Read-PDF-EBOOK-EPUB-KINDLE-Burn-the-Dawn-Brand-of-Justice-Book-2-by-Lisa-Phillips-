Burn the Dawn (Brand of Justice Book 2) by Lisa Phillips Book Review

Name: JBDAVIS1998
Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Lisa Phillips keeps getting better
Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2022
Review: Lisa Phillips has learned to really craft a story unlike many other writers in this genre. She‚Äôs learned that her protagonist can indeed wrestle with her faith and that God is big enough and has enough grace to allow that. She also doesn‚Äôt use some kind of deus ex machina to get all of the plot twists solved by the end of the story. She uses good old fashioned police work, by and large, in order to get things done. Ordinary people who do ordinary things get the job done both in this book, ‚ÄúBurn the Dawn‚Äù, and in ‚ÄúCold Dead Night‚Äù, the first book in what I hope is going to be a new series.
Yes, Kenna (the protagonist) has problems, and a lot of them. However, the exposition of her character is fascinating, and as I get to know her and the other long running characters, I find myself more and more engaged in the books and characters.
It‚Äôs a very good read and well worth the time and money spent.

Title: Great Storyline Continuation
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2023
Review: "Burn The Dawn" is a great continuation of the 1st book in the series, "Cold Dead Night". Kenna Banbury soldiers on into another case, all the while seeking tidbits of info on her deceased father's past. I never did figure out the 'whodunit' in this book, which just made the book even better in my eyes!!! I highly recommend not only this series but also ANY book by author Lisa Phillips!

Title: Don't pick this book if...
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2022
Review: If you're looking for a book that's easy to put down and pick up later this isn't it. This book is a great read and I read a LOT! The twists and turns keep coming and you never know who Kenna will find involved next. This is a read that keeps you guessing too. I had to put the book down a few times to do the mundane things we all have but when I picked it back up I was on the roller coaster ride again. Kenna is a great character and I'm glad to see that she is going to be involved in another "case". The unfortunate part is having to wait until February 2023 to read it.

Title: Full of surprises. Don't miss this great read.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2023
Review: Lisa Phillips comes up with a another great story. Still short on trust coming from her life experiences, Kenna finds a need for someone to be a sounding board. Who will not betray her?

Book two is just as exciting as the first one in this series.
I give a 4 1/2 rating on this story.
Sit down and get started reading!

Title: Excellent story
Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2022
Review: Wow. Over the years girls have gone missing. Some have been found whereas others haven't. Kenna is pulled into the case when a girl goes missing. Kenna assumes she'll leave town after the missing girl has been found and is doing okay, but she gets pulled further into the case as some of the members of the organization behind it all are eliminated and another girl disappears.
The sheriffs of the two neighboring counties don't get along with each other, so it was interesting to see how they handled things. We see flashbacks of Kenna and her dad when she was younger and learn why the town and one of the sheriffs are familiar to her. As always, the author likes to add multi layers, suspense, and mystery in her story.
I received a complimentary copy of this book and all thoughts and opinions are my own.

Title: Great book series!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2023
Review: Great read! Finished the first and immediately got the second in the series. It was a good read, and good to be able to read a book with language or scenes to make a person blush or skip over. Can't wait for Book 3!

Title: An incredible story
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2022
Review: This book is nearly impossible to put down. Very well written, researched and action packed. If you like suspense, intense, you will like this book, by one of my favorite authors. Try to guess who is behind this crime.
